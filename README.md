Financial Trading Strategy Repository

Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive framework for designing, testing, and evaluating financial trading strategies. The strategies leverage a combination of unsupervised learning, clustering techniques, and rule-based trading logic to make data-driven trading decisions. Key components include clustering models such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and K-Means, integrated with the Backtest library to validate their performance.

Key Features

Clustering-Based Strategies: Implementation of GMM, HMM, and K-Means for trend and regime detection.

Backtesting Framework: Utilizes the Backtest library for detailed performance evaluation.

Quantitative Analysis: Leverages QuantStats for in-depth performance reporting and metrics.

Trade Signal Integration: Combines machine learning outputs with rule-based logic for executing trades.

Extensible Codebase: Designed for integrating additional models and features such as VAE, ensemble models, and reinforcement learning.

Suggestions for Future Enhancements

Incorporating More Complex Strategies: Advanced models like reinforcement learning and meta-learning.

Using VAEs for Trend Detection: Enhance predictive capabilities with latent structure detection.

Integrating Ensemble Models: Combine multiple algorithms for robust decision-making.

Portfolio Optimization: Expand to multi-asset portfolio strategies.

Risk Management Enhancements: Implement dynamic position sizing and stop-loss mechanisms.
